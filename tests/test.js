OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes in the alemtuzumab phase 3 trials.  METHODS:  Patients who were treatment naive (Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif(®) Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis I [CARE-MS I]) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II) received annual courses of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day at baseline (5 days) and Month 12 (3 days) or subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 µg three times/week. QoL was measured every 6 or 12 months using Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis (FAMS), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36).  RESULTS:  Statistically significant improvements from baseline with alemtuzumab were observed on all three QoL instruments at the earliest post-baseline assessment and sustained through Year 2. Statistically significant greater QoL improvements over subcutaneous interferon beta-1a were seen at all time points in CARE-MS II with FAMS, EQ-VAS and SF-36 physical component summary, and in CARE-MS I with FAMS.  CONCLUSION:  Patients treated with alemtuzumab had improvements in physical, mental, and emotional QoL regardless of treatment history. Improvements were significantly greater with alemtuzumab versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a on both disease-specific and general measures of QoL.","Authors":"Arroyo González R|Kita M|Crayton H|Havrdova E|Margolin DH|Lake SL|Giovannoni G|","CorporateAuthor":"CARE-MS I and II Investigators|","Country":"England","CustomData":{},"DatabaseType":"MEDLINE","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516677589","FullTextURL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1352458516677589","ISSN":"1477-0970(Electronic)","JournalTitle":"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)","MedlineID":27885061,"ParentChildStatus":" ","ParentID":436085,"PublicationDate":"2016 Nov 24","PublicationYear":2016,"PubType":"Journal Article","ReferenceStudy":1879828,"Source":"Mult Scler. 2016 Nov 24;","TaStudyDesign":"RCT","Title":"Alemtuzumab improves quality-of-life outcomes compared with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
